# This is a static website

## What I'm going to do here?

- I am to grab markdown files from the static dir
- I am going to parse the _markdown_ files into html nodes, in a html tree structure with parent and children nodes
- I am going to generate html code from those nodes

```
I am adding this code block just for the heck of it
```

Oh and how could I forget this [link](http://google.com), I'll add an image later.
